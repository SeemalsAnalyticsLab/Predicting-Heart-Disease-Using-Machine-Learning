Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning
Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease using a dataset from the Cleveland database. By analyzing various clinical parameters, we aim to identify significant risk factors that contribute to heart disease, assisting in early diagnosis and prevention.

Steps Involved
Problem Definition: Classify whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical data.
Data Collection: The dataset includes key attributes like age, sex, cholesterol levels, and chest pain type.
Data Exploration: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize distributions and correlations between features.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Model Training: Split the data into training and testing sets, then train a Logistic Regression model to establish a performance baseline.
Model Improvement: Implement a Random Forest model to enhance predictive accuracy.
Feature Importance Visualization: Visualize feature importance to identify the most significant factors in predicting heart disease.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting heart disease, highlighting the critical features that influence risk. Future work could refine models and explore additional datasets for improved accuracy.
